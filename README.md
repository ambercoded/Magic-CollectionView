# Magic CollectionView
A physics-enabled UICollectionViewLayout that strives to provide a "magic" feel while scrolling.
The UIKit Dynamics Engine is used to create a wave-like physics reaction while scrolling.

Download the sample project to see it in action while scrolling through a list of yummy vegetables.

Simply add it to your project in two steps: 
1. Add the MagicCollectionViewFlowLayout file. 
2. Set your collectionView's layout to an instance of MagicCollectionViewFlowLayout.
